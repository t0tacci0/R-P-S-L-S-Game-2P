# Rock,Paper,Scissors,Lizard and Spock Game

Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock is a five-gesture expansion of the classic selection method
game rock-paper-scissors. It operates on the same basic principle, but includes two additional
weapons: the lizard (formed by the hand as a sock-puppet-like mouth) and Spock (formed by the
Star Trek Vulcan salute). This reduces the chances of a round ending in a tie. The game was
invented by Sam Kass with Karen Bryla, as "Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard".
